We have built our [integration test workflow](#running-our-integration-test-workflow-from-an-external-repo) to be reused by external repositories.

For customers wanting to run their own cluster configuration tests and checks, we have also created [github actions](#using-github-actions-to-independently-connect-a-cluster-to-arc-andor-deploy-aio) to both connect your cluster to ARC, and deploy AIO resources to the cluster.

## Running our integration test workflow from an external repo

We have an [integration test pipeline](./.github/workflows/int_test.yml) that other (public or private) repositories can utilize in order to trigger our CLI tests against a live cluster.

There are, however, some prerequisites and caveats that users should be made aware of.

### Prerequisites

- #### Service Principal and Federated Pipeline Permissions

  Our pipeline runs CLI commands to create and destroy resources using OpenID Connect.
  You will need to create or update an Entra application in Azure and configure it to federate a service principal connection from the repo/branch you plan to run your tests from.
  This service principal should also have correct permissions on the resource group you run these tests against.

  More information can be found in the following links:
  - [Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect)
  - [Configuring OpenID Connect in Azure](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure)


- #### Dedicated Resource Group for Testing
  You should provide a dedicated resource group for these testing resources.
  During the tests, resources will be created that may not be automatically cleaned up and are typically hidden from default Azure Portal UI views.

  Our tests use `az-iot-ops-test-cluster` prefixes for cluster resources and `opskv` for keyvaults.

- #### Understanding the matrix
  This section is to resolve any confusion caused by the matrix and it's format. The goal for the matrix is to have either one job or four jobs run during `Run Cluster Tests`.

  If you provide `runtime-init-args`, only one job (custom-input) will run, which will include an init test with your specified runtime init arguments. This allows you to test new init arguments. We do not run the other jobs since the runtime-init-args can conflict with their preset values.

  If you do *not* provide `runtime-init-args`, four jobs will run with pre-set init arguments (default, insecure-listener, no-syncrules, ca-certs). We do not run the other job since it will just be `az iot ops init` with no additional parameters.

  To achieve this, exclude is needed for the matrix. We have 5 options for features (what test to run) and 2 options for runtime-args (true or false based on if `runtime-init-args` populated). This results in 10 possibilities, but is narrowed down to 5 since runtime-args is evaluated before the matrix is even created. We further narrow down the number of jobs to be run by eliminating nonsense combinations [(custom-input, false); (default, true); (insecure-listener, true); (no-syncrules, true); (ca-certs, true)]. Eliminated combinations that are not present in our possible combinations are ignored.

  ##### **Input runtime-init-args is provided**

  If runtime-init-args is provided (ex: `--simulate-plc`), runtime-args will be set to `true`, resulting in the following possible combinations:

  - (custom-input, true)

  - (default, true)

  - (insecure-listener, true)

  - (no-syncrules, true)

  - (ca-certs, true)

  We eliminate nonsense combinations.  This leaves us with only:

  - (custom-input, true)

  And thus, one job will be run.

  ##### **Input runtime-init-args is not provided**

  If runtime-init-args is *not* provided (it is left blank), runtime-args will be set to `false`, resulting in the following possible combinations:

  - (custom-input, false)

  - (default, false)

  - (insecure-listener, false)

  - (no-syncrules, false)

  - (ca-certs, false)

  We eliminate nonsense combinations. This leaves us with:

  - (default, false)

  - (insecure-listener, false)

  - (no-syncrules, false)

  - (ca-certs, false)

  And thus, four jobs will be run.

### Inputs

**init-continue-on-error** | *Continue on error for init integration tests.*
**use-container** | *Build container image for tests*

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Run AIO CLI integration tests

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      resource-group:
        type: string
        default: my-aio-resource-group

permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read

jobs:
    run-integration-tests:
        uses: azure/azure-iot-ops-cli-extension/.github/workflows/int_test.yml@dev
        with:
            resource-group: ${{ inputs.resource-group }}
            custom-locations-oid: "custom-locations-object-id"
        secrets:
            AZURE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
            AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
            AZURE_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
            AIO_SP_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
            AIO_SP_OBJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OBJECT_ID }}
            AIO_SP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}

```

### Outputs

Currently this pipeline does not output values, it simply displays test pass/fail results.

### Considerations

#### CLI Extension Builds
Currently our pipeline uses the most recent dev branch of the IoT Operations extension to build our extension. The extension repo is cloned from the `dev` branch, the wheel is built from that source, and then added to the agent's CLI extension path.

## Using github actions to independently connect a cluster to ARC and/or deploy AIO

We have two custom actions for [connecting a kubernetes cluster to ARC](../.github/actions/connect-arc/action.yml), and for [deploying AIO resources](../.github/actions/deploy-aio/action.yml).
Both actions assume you have already logged into azure in your agent.

If a `config` value is provided, it will be written to disk as `~/.kube/config` and used to connect to your cluster. Otherwise, your local `~/.kube/config` file will be used.

- ### connect-arc
  This action is used to connect your kubernetes cluster to Azure ARC using `az connectedk8s connect`. It will add the connectedk8s Azure CLI extension if not already installed.

  If your logged-in azure principal doesn't have access to query graph, you'll also need to provide the `Custom Locations OID` in order to enable the `custom-locations` feature on your cluster.

- ### deploy-aio
  This action is used to deploy Azure IoT Operations resources to an existing ARC-connected cluster using the `azure-iot-ops` CLI extension.
  It will attempt to install our latest extension version from the public index using `az extension add` if not already installed in the agent.


### Example workflow steps

First, create a local cluster and store the kubeconfig in an environment variable:
```yaml
- name: "Create local k3s cluster"
  run: |
    sudo apt install nfs-common
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server" sh -s -
- name: "Store kubeconfig in environment variable"
  id: kubeconfig
  run: |
    {
      echo 'CONFIG<<EOF'
      sudo k3s kubectl config view --raw
      echo EOF
    } >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
```
Next, login to azure and connect your local cluster to ARC using inputs named `resource-group` and `cluster-name` (as well as your custom locations OID and a reference to your kubeconfig environment variable):
```yaml
- name: "Azure login"
  uses: azure/login@v2
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
- name: "ARC connect cluster"
  uses: azure/azure-iot-ops-cli-extension/.github/actions/connect-arc@dev
  with:
    cluster-name: ${{ inputs.cluster-name }}
    resource-group: ${{ inputs.resource-group }}
    config: ${{ env.CONFIG }}
    custom-locations-oid: 51dfe1e8-70c6-4de5-a08e-e18aff23d815
```

Finally, deploy AIO to the connected cluster using your previous inputs as well as the resource ID of your Key Vault and your Service Principal secrets:
```yaml
- name: "Deploy AIO"
  uses: azure/azure-iot-ops-cli-extension/.github/actions/deploy-aio@dev
  with:
    cluster: ${{ inputs.cluster-name }}
    resource-group: ${{ inputs.resource-group }}
    config: ${{ env.CONFIG }}
    keyvault-id: ${{ secrets.KV_ID }}
    sp-app-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    sp-object-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OBJECT_ID }}
    sp-secret: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```
