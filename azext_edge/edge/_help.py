            Azure IoT Operations is a set of highly aligned, but loosely coupled, first-party
            Kubernetes services that enable you to aggregate data from on-prem assets into an
            industrial-grade MQTT Broker, add edge compute and set up bi-directional data flow with
            a variety of services in the cloud.

            By default IoT Operations CLI commands will periodically check to see if a new extension version is available.
            This behavior can be disabled with `az config set iotops.check_latest=false`.

                If the OPC PLC service is in the same cluster and namespace as AIO, the target address should be formatted as `opc.tcp://{opc-plc-service-name}:{service-port}`
                If the OPC PLC service is in the same cluster but different namespace as AIO, include the service namespace like so `opc.tcp://{opc-plc-service-name}.{service-namespace}:{service-port}`
