The **Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI** aims to accelerate the development, management and automation of Azure IoT Operations solutions. It does this via addition of rich features and functionality to the official [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure).

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure Arc-enabled CNCF K8s cluster.
- Azure CLI `2.53.0` or higher. If you don't have az cli installed, follow [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install az iot ops extension

üåü Windows, macOS and common Linux environments are supported.

‚ùó Please uninstall the private preview `az edge` extension with `az extension remove --name azure-edge` if you have it installed.

The IoT Ops CLI is part of the Azure CLI extension index. Installation is as simple as:

```
az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
```

After install, the root command group `az iot ops` should be available and ready for use.

- List installed extensions with `az extension list`
- Remove an installed extension with `az extension remove --name <extension-name>`

## Connecting to a K8s cluster

üëâ To maintain minimum friction between K8s tools, the `az iot ops` edge side commands are designed to make use of your existing kube config (typically located at `~/.kube/config`).

All k8s interaction commands include an optional `--context` param. If none is provided `current_context` as defined in the kube config will be used.

## Available Functionality

üöÄ Always start with the `--help` flag to understand details about command groups, their containing commands & subgroups.

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-ops-cli-extension/wiki/Azure-IoT-Ops-Reference).
