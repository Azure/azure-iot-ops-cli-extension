The **Azure Edge extension for Azure CLI** aims to accelerate the development, management and automation of Azure Edge solutions. It does this via addition of rich features and functionality to the official [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure).
on.

## Pre-requisites

- Applicable services are deployed to CNCF K8s cluster
- This azure-edge extension requires az cli `2.39.0` or higher. If you don't have az cli installed, follow [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install az edge extension

üåü Windows, macOS and common Linux environments should be supported.

```bash
az config set extension.index_url="https://azedgecli.blob.core.windows.net/drop/index.json"
az extension add --name azure-edge
```

‚ùó **Note:** Currently the edge extension uses a private index URL. To list, install or update other Microsoft extensions reset your extension index URL via `az config set extension.index_url=""`.

After install, the root command group `az edge` should be available and ready for use.

- List installed extensions with `az extension list`
- Remove an installed extension with `az extension remove --name <extension-name>`

## Update az edge extension

Updates for `az edge` will be published on a continuous basis. With the [private index url](#install-az-edge-extension) set, you can:

- List the latest available client versions with `az extension list-available`
- Update in-place with `az extension update --name azure-edge`

## Connecting to a K8s cluster

üëâ To maintain minimum friction between K8s tools, the `az edge` edge side commands are designed to make use of your existing kube config (typically located at `~/.kube/config`).

All k8s interaction commands include an optional `--context` param. If none is provided `current_context` as defined in the kube config will be used.

## Available Functionality

üöÄ Always start with the `--help` flag to understand details about command groups, their containing commands & subgroups.

- `az edge check [--namespace] [--edge-service e4k] [--as-object] [--post] [--pre] [--context]`
- `az edge support`
  - `az edge support create-bundle [--edge-service auto|e4k|opcua|bluefin] [--log-age] [--context]`
- `az edge e4k`
  - `az edge e4k stats [--namespace] [--watch] [--refresh] [--raw] [--context]`
  - `az edge e4k get-password-hash [--iterations] [--phrase]`
